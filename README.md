# blacklivesmatter For Linux
Black Lives Matter for Linux is a free software version of the commercial Black Lives Matter game available in the Steam store. 

There are two implementations available for your enjoyment in this repository:

* blacklivesmatter.c is written in C using glut/OpenGL.
* blacklivesmatter.sh is a simple shell script implementation.

Both will, like the commercial "Black Lives Matter" Steam game, turn your screen black for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in solidarity with the #blacklivesmatter movement.

You can read more about the background and the reasons for creating this game at https://linuxreviews.org/Black_Lives_Matter_For_Linux

Both implementations are available as free software under the GNU GPL.
